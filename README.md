# Intermediate SQL - Sales Analysis

## Overview
Analysis of customer behavior, retention, and lifetime value for an e-commerce company to improve customer retention and maximize revenue.

## Business Questions
1. **Customer Segmentation:** Who are our most valuable customers?
2. **Cohort Analysis:** How do different customer groups generate revenue?
3. **Retention Analysis:** Which customers haven't purchased recently?

## Analysis Approach

### 1. Customer Segmentation Analysis
- Categorized customers based on total lifetime value (LTV)
- Assigned customers to High, Mid, and Low-value segments
- Calculated key metrics: total revenue

🖥️ Query: [1_customer_segmentation.sql](1_customer_segmentation.sql)

**📈 Visualization:**

📊 **Key Findings:**
- High-value segment (25% of customers) drives 66% of revenue ($135.4M)
- Mid-value segment (50% of customers) generates 32% of revenue ($66.6M)
- Low-value segment (25% of customers) accounts for 2% of revenue ($4.3M)

💡 **Business Insights**
- High-Value (66% revenue): Offer premium membership program to 12,372 VIP customers, as losing one customer significantly impacts revenue
- Mid-Value (32% revenue): Create upgrade paths through personalized promotions, with potential $66.6M → $135.4M revenue opportunity
- Low-Value (2% revenue): Design re-engagement campaigns and price-sensitive promotions to increase purchase frequency

### 2. Cohort Analysis
- Tracked revenue and customer count per cohorts
- Cohorts were grouped by year of first purchase
- Analyzed customer retention at a cohort level

🖥️ Query: [2_cohort_analysis.sql](/2_cohort_analysis.sql)

**📈 Visualization:**

📊 **Key Findings:**
- Revenue per customer shows an alarming decreasing trend over time
  - 2022-2024 cohorts are consistently performing worse than earlier cohorts
  - NOTE: Although net revenue is increasing, this is likely due to a larger customer base, which is not reflective of customer value

💡 **Business Insights**
- Value extracted from customers is decreasing over time and needs further investigation.
- In 2023 we saw a drop in number of customers acquired, which is concerning.
- With both lowering LTV and decreasing customer acquisition, the company is facing a potential revenue decline.

### 3. Customer Retention
🖥️ Query: [3_retention_analysis.sql](3_retention_analysis.sql)

- Identified customers at risk of churning
- Analyzed last purchase patterns
- Calculated customer-specific metrics

**📈 Visualization:**

<img src="images/3_customer_churn_cohort_year.png" alt="Customer Churn by Cohort Year" style="width: 50%; height: auto;">

📊 **Key Findings:**  
- Cohort churn stabilizes at ~90% after 2-3 years, indicating a predictable long-term retention pattern.  
- Retention rates are consistently low (8-10%) across all cohorts, suggesting retention issues are systemic rather than specific to certain years.  
- Newer cohorts (2022-2023) show similar churn trajectories, signaling that without intervention, future cohorts will follow the same pattern.  

💡 **Business Insights:**  
- Strengthen early engagement strategies to target the first 1-2 years with onboarding incentives, loyalty rewards, and personalized offers to improve long-term retention.  
- Re-engage high-value churned customers by focusing on targeted win-back campaigns rather than broad retention efforts, as reactivating valuable users may yield higher ROI.  
- Predict & preempt churn risk and use customer-specific warning indicators to proactively intervene with at-risk users before they lapse.

## Strategic Recommendations

1. **Customer Value Optimization** (Customer Segmentation)
   - Launch VIP program for 12,372 high-value customers (66% revenue)
   - Create personalized upgrade paths for mid-value segment ($66.6M → $135.4M opportunity)
   - Design price-sensitive promotions for low-value segment to increase purchase frequency

2. **Cohort Performance Strategy** (Customer Revenue by Cohort)
   - Target 2022-2024 cohorts with personalized re-engagement offers
   - Implement loyalty/subscription programs to stabilize revenue fluctuations
   - Apply successful strategies from high-spending 2016-2018 cohorts to newer customers

3. **Retention & Churn Prevention** (Customer Retention)
   - Strengthen first 1-2 year engagement with onboarding incentives and loyalty rewards
   - Focus on targeted win-back campaigns for high-value churned customers
   - Implement proactive intervention system for at-risk customers before they lapse
